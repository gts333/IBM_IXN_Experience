# Industry Exchange Network
This is the final year project for Tangsheng Geng at UCL, which is building an online community for IBM IXN to allow
information display and interaction among industries, students and universities.  

The application is deployed on IBM cloud using Docker and Kubernetes.  
Link: The application is in its test version, which has substantial vulnerabilities, so the link for the application it is not exposed to the public.
However if you are interested in taking a look(but not trying to exploit its vulnerabilities) please email gengtangsheng@outlook.com to get a link.   

The application makes use of the IBM DB2 online database.  

The project began in January, but the initial commit took place in late March. This is because the project has gone through a refactor process incorporating springboot and the old repository has been cleared.
