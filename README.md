# Industry Exchange Network
This is the final year project by Tangsheng Geng at UCL, which is building an online community for IBM IXN to allow
information display and interaction among industries, students and universities.  

The application is deployed on IBM cloud using Docker and Kubernetes.  
The application makes use of the IBM DB2 online database for data storage and the IBM Watson AI on Natural language processing for user input analysis.
