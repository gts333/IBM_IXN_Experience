                Ghana were in the tournament's Group C, alongside Algeria, Senegal and South Africa.[8] CAF labelled this the "group of death" as a result of the strength of the four teams.[9] Ghana's opening game took place on 19 January 2015, against Senegal in Mongomo.[10] Ghana took the lead on 14 minutes through a penalty by André Ayew, after Christian Atsu had been fouled, but Senegal equalised in the second half through Mame Biram Diouf. Moussa Sow, a Senegalese substitute, then scored in the third minute of injury time, to give his team a 2–1 win.[11] In their second game, Ghana faced Algeria on 23 January in Mongomo.[12] The match remained goalless until injury time at the end in the second half, when Ghana took the lead as Asamoah Gyan scored from a long pass by Mubarak Wakaso.[13] Going into the final pair of games in the group, all four nations had an opportunity to qualify for the quarter-finals, but wins for Ghana and Algeria ensured they qualified in first and second place respectively. Ghana fell behind to a volley by South African Mandla Masango in their game, played on 27 January in Mongomo, but a John Boye equaliser on 73 minutes, followed by an Ayew goal gave them a 2–1 win and first place in the group.[14][15]
